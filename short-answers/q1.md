# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Instance properties are defined within the constructor method of a class using the `this` keyword. Each `new` instance of a class will have it's own copy of these properties. Instance methods are also defined within the class body without the `static` keyword because they operate on instance properties.

Class properties are defined outside the constructor using the `static` keyword making them attatched to the class itself and not through instances. This makes them only accessible through the Class itself. Class methods and properties can only access other static properties and methods.
